### 🖥️ Installing

Clone the repo and build with `make`:

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/librity/ft_pipex.git
$ cd ft_pipex
$ make
```

It works exactly like `< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`:

```bash
./pipex infile "ls" "wc" outfile

./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile
./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile

./pipex .gitignore "tr a b" "tr b c" outfile
./pipex EOF "tr a b" "tr b c" outfile
./pipex .gitignore "ping 8.8.8.8" "grep ms" outfile
```

## 🛸 42 São Paulo <a name = "ft_sp"></a>

Part of the larger [42 Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/),
[42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/) is a software engineering school
that offers a healthy alternative to traditional education:

- It doesn't have any teachers and classes.
- Students learn by cooperating
  and correcting each other's work (peer-to-peer learning).
- Its focus is as much on social skills as it is on technical skills.
- It's completely free to anyone that passes its selection process -

It's an amazing school, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.
